The Weather Dashboard project successfully integrates the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather updates, 5-day forecasts, and search history tracking. Key features include:

Dynamic Weather Updates: Users can search for any city and view its current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and a visual weather icon.

5-Day Forecast: Displays future weather trends with clear and organized data.

Search History: Keeps a log of previously searched cities for quick access.

Interactive Map: Highlights the searched location using geographical coordinates.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with React and styled for accessibility and aesthetics.
